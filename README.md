# Defang Workshop Structures

Just a place to keep track of how we organize workshops.

## List of workshops

* [Entry Level](https://defanglabs.github.io/workshops/?workshop=entry-level)
* [Advanced](https://defanglabs.github.io/workshops/?workshop=advanced)
* [Open Source LLM Hosting](https://defanglabs.github.io/workshops/?workshop=open-source-ai-models)

## How To

Write a workshop as a Markdown file (using format expected by https://revealjs.com/) in the [workshops](./workshops) directory.

Then you can load the workshop at this format of url: 
`https://defanglabs.github.io/workshops/?workshop=<workshop-file-name-minus-md>`

So if your workshop is in `./workshops/my-cool-workshop.md` then you would access it at `https://defanglabs.github.io/workshops/?workshop=my-cool-workshop`
